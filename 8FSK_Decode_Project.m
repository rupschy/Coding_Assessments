%% Anwers to questions:
% Decrease Audibility

% I think there are a few different ways to tackle all of these improvements, 
% but a crucial concern with audibility is Fs or sampling rate- As so many components 
% of audio software are dependent on sampling rate, having a higher sampling rate has the potential 
% to increase Nyquist and thus increase the top-end of what modulated frequencies can be output. 
% A choice such as Fs = 96000  would ensure that, from a software standpoint, the signals would be 
% imperceivable to the average adult. 


% Increase throughput

% To increase throughput of data, reduction of symbol duration as a ratio of Fs such that: 
% symbol_duration â‰¤ Fs/100. This size can be even smaller if Fs is increased as stated prior. 
% Additionally, multiple frequencies can be used in a single symbol duration, provided that these are 
% in harmonic series which do not interact with each other (ensuring isolation for each frequency found 
% from frequency-domain transform. With this, the potential for enhanced encryption is possible. 
% For example, multiple frequencies can be played for a given symbol, however the analysis device would 
% know to look for highest or lowest frequencies per-frame across a group of symbols-frequency pairs. 
% In short, smaller symbol duration increases the number of symbols able to be processed in the same timeframe. 
% However, symbol length reduction can be detrimental to accuracy of the frequency-domain transform, 
% which makes Fs-to-symbol_length ratio so important to consider.


% Increase reliability

% To increase reliability of analysis for symbol output, ensuring a minimum length of time between preambles 
% would be preferable. The rationale being, the smaller the gap between symbol phrase and the next preamble, 
% the shorter the signal length will be. Reliability in terms of the frequency-domain transform used in this 
% algorithm showed 100 percent accuracy for frequency identification at a Fs to symbol_duration ratio of 100:1. 
% The ability to make this even smaller of a frame size while achieving reasonable accuracy would make processing 
% times quicker theoretically.
